/*

JS ARRAY:

special type of variable that can contain many values, stored inside []

=> let arr = [ value1, value2, value3] => coma separated

each element can be accessed by an  index number
first value has index [0], second [1]....

exemple => console.log(arr[1])  // output here is value2


DIFFERENCE BTW ARRAY and OBJECT :

Arrays use numbered index []
=>use Array when you want the element's name to be numbers


Object use named index ( remember pairs of {name : value} )
=> use object when you want the element's name to be a string ""
